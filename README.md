# Pipe-visualization-on-VR
Simple Gear VR application made on Unity that creates random pipes, joins them together and makes the player run through those pipes. The app was made using help from catlikecoding.com. 

# Dependencies
Unity 5.4.1f1
Oculus Mobile SDK 1.0.3
Oculus Utilities for Unity 5 1.8.0

# Running
The pipeGame.apk file found in the root directory should be enough to run the game on a mobile device running on Android with Gear VR. If you want to mess around with the source code, then you would need to set up the Unity development environment.

# Take away lesson
Playing with VR is interesting and Unity is super easy to pick up if you know how to code and have basic high-school physics knowledge. Oculus is rapidly changing though, so most of the tutorial get outdated in a few months. The intention of this app was to create a simple trippy VR game. Although I haven't added any movement controls, but that part is easy.
